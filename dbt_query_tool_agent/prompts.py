DBT_MODEL_SQL_PROMPT = """
    
    **Instructions for DBT Models (SQL Files):**
    1. **Model Structure**: For each identified 'Target table', generate a complete and valid BigQuery DBT SQL model.
    2. **File Naming Convention**: The model should conceptually be saved in
    `models/{target_model_name.replace('shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.', '').replace('.', '_')}.sql`. (e.g.,
    `onsfdp.sql` for `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.onsfdp`).
    3. **CTE (`source_data`)**: Start with a Common Table Expression (CTE) named
    `source_data`. This CTE should select all necessary columns from the primary source table and
    any joined tables.
    4. **Source Referencing (Crucial - Use `source` macro)**:
       - For raw source tables, always use DBT's `{{{{ source('dataset_name', 'table_name') }}}}` macro.
       - To get `dataset_name` and `table_name` from a full table identifier like `project_id.dataset_name.table_name` (e.g., `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.onspd_full`):
         - The `dataset_name` is the second part (e.g., `test_lbg`).
         - The `table_name` is the third part (e.g., `onspd_full`).
       - Example: `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.onspd_full` should be referenced as `{{{{ source('test_lbg', 'onspd_full') }}}}`.
       - If a table is a DBT model (meaning it's a target table from a previous step), use `{{{{ ref('model_name') }}}}`. The `model_name` is typically the last part of the target table identifier after the dataset/schema.
       - Assume all full table names (e.g., `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.ITL125`) are raw sources unless explicitly noted as a dbt `ref`.
    5. **Joins in CTE**: Include `LEFT JOIN` clauses within the `source_data` CTE based
    on the 'Join Table' and 'Join Key' information. Assign aliases (T1, T2, T3, etc.) as indicated in
    the STTM or consistently if not explicitly given.
    6. **Final `SELECT` Statement**: In the main `SELECT` Statement after the CTE,
    apply the 'Transformation Logic / Derivation Rule' for each 'Target Column'.
    7. **Aliasing Target Columns**: Alias each transformed expression to its `Target
    Column` name.
    8. **BigQuery Syntax**: Ensure all SQL functions and syntax are compatible with
    BigQuery.
    9. **Escape Backslashes**: If transformation logic contains escaped backslashes (e.g.,
    `\\n`), ensure they are correctly represented in the generated SQL (e.g., `\\n` remains `\\n` for
    BigQuery string literals if it's meant to be a literal newline).

DBT_SNAPSHOT_SQL_PROMPT = """
    **Instructions for DBT Snapshots (SQL Files):**
    1. **Purpose**: Generate DBT snapshot configurations for Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2).
    2. **File Naming Convention**: Snapshots should conceptually be saved in `snapshots/{snapshot_name}.sql`.
    3. **Snapshot Configuration**: Include the `{% snapshot %}` and `{% endsnapshot %}` block.
       - Define `unique_key` based on the primary key of the source table.
       - Define `strategy` as `check`.
       - Define `check_cols` as `all` or a specific list of columns to monitor for changes.
       - Define `target_schema` and `target_database` if necessary. If the user provides a `schema` for the dbt profile, use that for `target_schema` in the snapshot config.
    4. **Source Table**: The `select` statement within the snapshot block should select all columns from the source table that is being snapshotted. Use `{{{{ source('dataset_name', 'table_name') }}}}` or `{{{{ ref('model_name') }}}}` for the source, following the same parsing rules as for models.
    5. **Example Structure**:
       ```sql
       {% snapshot your_snapshot_name %}

       {{ config(
           target_schema='your_dbt_schema',
           unique_key='id',
           strategy='check',
           check_cols=['column1', 'column2', 'column3']
       ) }}

       {% endsnapshot %}
       ```
 """
DBT_MACRO_SQL_PROMPT = """
    **Instructions for DBT Macros (SQL or Jinja Files):**
    1. **Purpose**: Generate reusable Jinja macros for common SQL patterns or complex logic.
    2. **File Naming Convention**: Macros should conceptually be saved in `macros/{macro_name}.sql` or `macros/{macro_name}.jinja`.
    3. **Macro Definition**: Start with `{% macro macro_name(arg1, arg2, ...) %}` and end with `{% endmacro %}`.
    4. **Logic**: Implement the desired SQL or Jinja logic within the macro.
    5. **Output**: The macro should return a SQL string or a transformed value.
    6. **Example Structure**:
       ```sql
       {% macro generate_full_name(first_name, last_name) %}
           {{ first_name }} || ' ' || {{ last_name }}
       {% endmacro %}
       ```
"""
DBT_PROFILES_YML_PROMPT = """
    **Instructions for DBT `profiles.yml` (YAML File):**
    1. **Purpose**: Generate a `profiles.yml` file to configure dbt connections to your data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery).
    2. **File Naming Convention**: The file should be named `profiles.yml` and stored at the root of the dbt project.
    3. **Configuration**: Include the `dbt_project_name` (from GCS URL), `project_id`, `dataset_name`, `region`, `schema`, `threads`, and `timeout_seconds`.
    4. **Example Structure**:
       ```yaml
       # profiles.yml

"""

DBT_SCHEMA_YML_PROMPT = """
    **Instructions for DBT `schema.yml` (YAML File):**
    1. **Purpose**: Generate a `schema.yml` file to define and document your dbt sources and models, including their descriptions. This helps with data governance and understanding.
    2. **File Naming Convention**: The file should be named `schema.yml` and stored within the `models/` folder or a relevant subfolder (e.g., `models/staging/schema.yml`). For this task, assume `models/schema.yml`.
    3. **Content**:
       - For **sources**: Identify all unique `project_id.dataset.table_name` combinations from the 'Source Table' column in the mapping. For each unique source:
         - Define it under a `sources:` block.
         - Extract `project_id` from the second part of the full identifier (e.g., `shruti-test-414408` from `project.test_lbg.table`). Use this as the `database` for the source.
         - Extract `dataset_name` from the second part of the full identifier (e.g., `test_lbg` from `project.test_lbg.table`). Use this as the `schema` for the source.
         - Include a `description` (e.g., "Raw data source for X").
         - Under `tables:`, list each table with its `name` (the third part, e.g., `onspd_full`) and a `description`.
         - Do NOT include `columns` under models.
         
       - For **models**: Identify all unique 'Target table' names from the mapping. For each unique target model:
         - Define it under a `models:` block.
         - Extract `model_name` from the last part of the target table identifier (e.g., `onsfdp` from `project.dataset.onsfdp`). Use this as the `name` for the model.
         - Include a `description` (e.g., "Transformed model for Y").
         - Do NOT include `columns` under models.
         
    4. **Example Structure**:
       ```yaml
       # models/schema.yml
       version: 2

       sources:
         - name: src_schema
           database: your_source_projectid # e.g., shruti-test-414408
           schema : your_dataset_name # e.g., test_lbg
           description: "Raw data source for X"
           tables:

               description: "Description for source_table_1"
             - name: your_source_table_2 # e.g., ITL125
               description: "Description for source_table_2"

       models:
         - name: your_target_model_1 # e.g., onsfdp
           description: "Transformed model for Y"
       ```
   """
DBT_TEST_SQL_PROMPT = """
    **Instructions for DBT Model Tests (SQL Files):**
    1. **Purpose**: Generate standalone dbt test SQL files for the target model. These tests will assert specific data quality or transformation accuracy based on the provided Source-to-Target Mapping (STTM).
    2. **File Naming Convention**: Each test should be a separate `.sql` file, named descriptively within the `tests/` folder (e.g., `tests/assert_model_unique_id_not_null.sql`, `tests/assert_model_valid_status_values.sql`). The name should clearly indicate the test's purpose and the model it applies to.
    3. **Content**:
       - Each `.sql` test file **must contain a complete, runnable SQL query**. This query should return **zero rows** if the test passes, and **one or more rows** if the test fails.
       - Use the `{{{{ ref('your_model_name') }}}}` macro to refer to the dbt model being tested.
       - **Smart Test Scenario Generation from STTM**: Analyze the STTM comprehensively to infer and apply **all possible relevant test scenarios** for each target column or the model as a whole. Do not limit the inference to the examples provided; these are merely illustrative. For each inferred test, generate a complete SQL query.

       - **Crucial Formatting for Multiple Tests**: When generating multiple tests, separate each test block with `---` followed by `output_file_name: {test_file_name}.sql` on a new line. **The SQL content for the test must immediately follow this `output_file_name` line, with no empty lines or additional text in between.**

       - Consider the following types of tests based on the STTM:
         - **Primary Key Uniqueness and Not Null**: For columns identified as primary keys (unique, not null, or part of a composite key).
         - **Foreign Key Relationships**: For columns representing foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity with parent models.
         - **Accepted Values**: For columns with a predefined set of expected values, enumerated types, or categories derived from transformations.
         - **Value Range Checks**: For numeric or date columns with implied or explicit minimum/maximum values, or other domain constraints.
         - **Null Values for Non-Nullable Columns**: For columns that should always contain data based on source properties or transformation logic.
         - **Data Type Consistency**: While dbt doesn't have direct SQL tests for this, consider if transformations could lead to implicit type conversions and if data integrity relies on specific types.
         - **Row Counts/Volume**: If the STTM implies a certain cardinality or expected number of rows (e.g., all source rows should appear in target, or a specific join type implies a fixed number of rows).
         - **Sum/Aggregate Checks**: If the STTM involves aggregations, test that the aggregated values match expected sums or counts from the source.
         - **Date/Time Logic**: If date transformations are involved (e.g., `DATE_DIFF`, `EXTRACT`), test the correctness of the resulting date/time values.
         - **String Transformations**: For columns undergoing string manipulation (e.g., `TRIM`, `CONCAT`, `REPLACE`), test the correctness of the output format or content.
         - **Business Rule Compliance / Derivation Logic Validation**: This is crucial. For columns with 'Transformation Logic / Derivation Rule' defined in the STTM, generate tests that directly validate this logic. This might involve:
           - Re-applying the derivation rule to the source data within the test query and comparing the result with the value in the target model.
           - Checking if the transformed value meets specific criteria implied by the business rule (e.g., a derived status field should only be 'Active' or 'Inactive' based on specific conditions).
           - Ensuring calculated fields (e.g., `total_amount = quantity * price`) are correctly computed.

         - **Example for generating multiple tests (Pay close attention to immediate SQL content after `output_file_name`):**
           ```sql
           ---
           output_file_name: assert_your_model_unique_id_not_null.sql
           select
             unique_id
           from {{{{ ref('your_model_name') }}}}
           where unique_id is null; -- Add semicolon for clarity

           ---
           output_file_name: assert_your_model_unique_id_is_unique.sql
           select
             unique_id
           from {{{{ ref('your_model_name') }}}}
           group by 1
           having count(*) > 1; -- Add semicolon for clarity

           ---
           output_file_name: assert_your_model_full_name_derivation_correct.sql
           select
             t.customer_id
           from {{{{ ref('your_model_name') }}}} t
           join {{{{ source('your_source_dataset', 'your_source_table') }}}} s -- Assuming source table is reachable and contains first/last name
             on t.customer_id = s.customer_id
           where t.full_name != s.first_name || ' ' || s.last_name; -- Add semicolon for clarity
           ```
    4. **Test Naming Convention in Prompt**: The `output_file_name` should be descriptive of the test and include the model name (e.g., `model_name_unique_id_not_null_test.sql`). The agent will generate one test file at a time, so pick a relevant test scenario based on the STTM.
