DBT_MODEL_SQL_PROMPT = """
    
    **Instructions for DBT Models (SQL Files):**
    Your single most important task is to generate a complete and syntactically correct BigQuery SQL query. Do not truncate the output.
    1. **Model Structure**: For each identified 'Target table', generate a complete and valid BigQuery DBT SQL model.
    2. **File Naming Convention**: The model should conceptually be saved in
    `models/{target_model_name.replace('shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.', '').replace('.', '_')}.sql`. (e.g.,
    `onsfdp.sql` for `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.onsfdp`).
    3. **CTE (`source_data`)**: Start with a Common Table Expression (CTE) named
    `source_data`. This CTE should select all necessary columns from the primary source table and
    any joined tables.
    4. **Source Referencing (Crucial - Use `source` macro)**:
       - For raw source tables, always use DBT's `{{ source('dataset_name', 'table_name') }}` macro.
       - To get `dataset_name` and `table_name` from a full table identifier like `project_id.dataset_name.table_name` (e.g., `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.onspd_full`):
         - The `dataset_name` is the second part (e.g., `test_lbg`).
         - The `table_name` is the third part (e.g., `onspd_full`).
       - Example: `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.onspd_full` should be referenced as `{{ source('test_lbg', 'onspd_full') }}`.
       - If a table is a DBT model (meaning it's a target table from a previous step), use `{{ ref('model_name') }}`. The `model_name` is typically the last part of the target table identifier after the dataset/schema.
       - Assume all full table names (e.g., `shruti-test-414408.test_lbg.ITL125`) are raw sources unless explicitly noted as a dbt `ref`.
    5. **Joins and Alias Resolution**:
       - Include `LEFT JOIN` clauses within the `source_data` CTE based on the 'Join Table' and 'Join Key' information.
       - **Alias Resolution**: The STTM might use ambiguous aliases like 'T2' for different join tables. You MUST assign a unique, sequential alias (T1, T2, T3, ...) to each unique source table and use that unique alias consistently in the join conditions and the final SELECT. T1 is always the primary source table.
    6. **SQL Dialect Conversion**:
       - The 'Transformation Logic' may contain SQL syntax from other dialects (e.g., PostgreSQL). You MUST convert this to standard BigQuery SQL.
       - For example:
         - Convert `SUBSTRING(column FROM start FOR length)` to `SUBSTR(column, start, length)`.
         - Convert `Position(' ' IN column)` to `STRPOS(column, ' ')`.
         - Convert `CAST(column TO datatype)` to `CAST(column AS datatype)`.
    7. **Final `SELECT` Statement and Column Sourcing**:
      - **Deduplication**: If the source data might contain duplicate rows and no single primary key is being used to uniquely identify rows, use `SELECT DISTINCT` in the final `SELECT` statement to ensure the model produces unique records.
      - Every column in the final `SELECT` statement must exist in the `source_data` CTE or be derived in an intermediate CTE.
       - For each 'Target Column' in the STTM, you will create a corresponding column in the final `SELECT` statement.
       - **Transformation Logic is Priority**: If the 'Transformation Logic / Derivation Rule' column is NOT empty, you MUST use that logic to generate the column. The source columns used in the logic must be referenced with their correct table aliases (T1, T2, etc.) from the CTE.
       - **Direct Mapping as Fallback**: If the 'Transformation Logic / Derivation Rule' column IS empty, then and only then should you perform a direct mapping. For direct mappings:
         - **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL**: If a 'Join Table' is specified for that row, you MUST select the 'Source Column' from the alias of that 'Join Table' (e.g., `T3.PCONM`). **DO NOT default to selecting from T1 if a join table is provided.** This is the most common source of errors.
         - If no 'Join Table' is specified, select the 'Source Column' from the primary table alias (T1).
    8. **Aliasing Target Columns**: Alias each transformed expression to its `Target Column` name.
    9. **BigQuery Syntax**: Ensure all SQL functions and syntax are compatible with BigQuery.
    10. **Handling Dependencies**: If one target column's transformation logic depends on another derived target column (e.g., `INBND_POST_CODE` depends on `POST_CODE`), you must use a second CTE (e.g., `intermediate_derivations`) to calculate the dependency first. Then, select from that intermediate CTE to calculate the final dependent columns.
    11. **Escape Backslashes**: If transformation logic contains escaped backslashes (e.g., `\\n`), ensure they are correctly represented in the generated SQL (e.g., `\\n` remains `\\n` for BigQuery string literals if it's meant to be a literal newline).

    1. **Purpose**: Generate a `schema.yml` file to define and document your dbt sources and models, including their descriptions. This helps with data governance and understanding.
    2. **File Naming Convention**: The file should be named `schema.yml` and stored within the `models/` folder or a relevant subfolder (e.g., `models/staging/schema.yml`). For this task, assume `models/schema.yml`.
    3. **Content**:
       - For **sources**: You MUST identify all unique source tables by scanning both the 'Source Table' and 'Join Table' columns in the STTM. For each unique `project_id.dataset.table_name` combination you find:
         - Define it under a `sources:` block.
         - **CRITICAL**: The `name` of the source block MUST be **exactly** the dataset name (e.g., `test_lbg`). Do NOT add any prefixes or suffixes like `_source`. This name is directly used by the `source()` macro in models.
         - The `database` should be the project ID (e.g., `shruti-test-414408`).
         - The `schema` should be the dataset name (e.g., `test_lbg`).
         - Include a `description` (e.g., "Raw data source for X").
         - Under `tables:`, list each table with its `name` (the table name part, e.g., `onspd_full`) and a `description`. You must include every table found in the STTM.
         
       - For **models**: Identify all unique 'Target table' names from the mapping. For each unique target model:
         - Define it under a `models:` block.
         - **CRITICAL**: The `name` for the model MUST be the model name you are given in the prompt (e.g., 'ons'). Do NOT infer it from the target table name in the STTM.
         - Include a `description` (e.g., "Transformed model for Y").
         - Do NOT include `columns` under models.

   """
DBT_TEST_SQL_PROMPT = """
    **Instructions for Generating dbt SQL Test Scripts from a Test Plan:**

    1. **Primary Goal**: Your task is to act as a dbt test script generator. You will be given the content of a test plan (in CSV format) and you MUST convert **every row** of that test plan into a separate, runnable dbt SQL test file.

    2. **Input**: The input will be the full text of a test plan CSV file. It contains columns like "Test ID", "Test Type", "Model/Component Tested", "Target Column(s)", "Source Columns", and "Derivation Rule/Condition".

    3. **Crucial Output Formatting**:
       - You MUST generate a single text response that contains a separate SQL script for each row in the input CSV.
       - Each script within your response MUST be separated by a line containing only `---`.
       - Immediately following the `---` separator, you MUST add a line specifying the filename: `output_file_name: {test_file_name}.sql`.
       - The `{test_file_name}` MUST be taken directly from the "Test ID" column of the corresponding row in the test plan.
       - The SQL code for the test MUST begin on the very next line after the `output_file_name` directive. Do not add extra blank lines or commentary.

    4. **General SQL Generation Rules**:
       - **Model Reference**: To refer to the dbt model being tested, you MUST use the `{{ ref('model_name') }}` macro. The `model_name` will be explicitly provided to you in the instructions (e.g., 'The model being tested is named 'ons''). **You MUST use this provided model name.** IGNORE the 'Model/Component Tested' column in the test plan CSV and use the name from the instructions instead. This is critical to avoid referencing a non-existent model.
       - **Source Reference**: To refer to raw source tables, you MUST use the `{{ source('dataset_name', 'table_name') }}` macro. You will need to infer the `dataset_name` and `table_name` from the context provided in the "Source Columns" or "Derivation Rule/Condition" columns.
       - **Passing Tests**: A test passes if the generated SQL query returns zero rows.
       - **SQL Dialect**: All generated SQL MUST be valid for Google BigQuery.

       - **SQL Dialect Conversion (Crucial for Transformation Tests)**:
         - The 'Derivation Rule/Condition' from the test plan may contain non-BigQuery SQL. You MUST convert it to standard BigQuery syntax.
         - For example, convert `OReplace` to `REPLACE`, `SUBSTRING(col FROM x FOR y)` to `SUBSTR(col, x, y)`, etc.

    5. **Templates by "Test Type"**:
       You MUST generate the SQL based on the value in the "Test Type" column. Follow these templates precisely.

       - **If "Test Type" is 'Uniqueness'**:
         - The query should find duplicate values in the "Target Column(s)".
         - **Template**:
           ```sql
           select
             {{ Target Column(s) }}
           from {{ ref('Model/Component Tested') }}
           where {{ Target Column(s) }} is not null
           group by 1
           having count(*) > 1
           ```

       - **If "Test Type" is 'Null Check'**:
         - The query should find null values in the "Target Column(s)".
         - **Template**:
           ```sql
           select
             {{ Target Column(s) }}
           from {{ ref('Model/Component Tested') }}
           where {{ Target Column(s) }} is null
           ```

       - **If "Test Type" is 'Referential Integrity'**:
         - The query should find values in the child model's column that do not exist in the parent source's column.
         - You must infer the parent table from the "Source Columns" and "Derivation Rule/Condition".
         - **Template**:
           ```sql
           -- This test checks that every value in the target column of the model
           -- exists in the corresponding source column of the source table.
           select t.{{ Target Column(s) }}
           from {{ ref('Model/Component Tested') }} as t
           left join {{ source('source_dataset', 'source_table') }} as s on t.{{ Target Column(s) }} = s.{{ Source Columns }}
           where t.{{ Target Column(s) }} is not null and s.{{ Source Columns }} is null
           ```

       - **If "Test Type" is 'Accepted Values'**:
         - The query should find values that are not in the list of expected values.
         - You must parse the list of accepted values from the "Expected Result" or "Derivation Rule/Condition" column.
         - **Template**:
           ```sql
           select
             {{ Target Column(s) }}
           from {{ ref('Model/Component Tested') }}
           where {{ Target Column(s) }} not in ('value_1', 'value_2', 'etc')
           ```

       - **If "Test Type" is 'Transformation Logic' (Most Complex)**:
         - This test requires you to re-implement the transformation logic from the source data and compare it to the final data in the model.
         - You MUST join the final model back to the original source tables.
         - **CRITICAL**: You must correctly identify all source tables and their join keys from the "Derivation Rule/Condition" and "Source Columns" to build the `source_data` CTE.
         - **CRITICAL for `source_data` CTE**: When building the `source_data` CTE, you MUST ALWAYS include the source column that corresponds to the primary key of the final model (e.g., `PCDS` is the source for `POST_CODE`). This column is essential for joining the `model_data` CTE back to the source. You must also include all other source columns mentioned in the 'Derivation Rule/Condition'.
         - **Template**:
           ```sql
           -- This test joins the final model back to the source(s) to verify the transformation logic.
           with source_data as (
               -- Re-create the necessary source data view here.
               -- This may involve selecting from one or more source tables and joining them.
               select
                 t1.source_col_1,
                 t1.primary_key,
                 t2.source_col_2
               from {{ source('source_dataset', 'source_table_1') }} as t1
               left join {{ source('source_dataset', 'source_table_2') }} as t2 on t1.join_key = t2.join_key
           ),
           model_data as (
               -- Select the primary key and the target column from the final model.
               select primary_key, {{ Target Column(s) }} from {{ ref('Model/Component Tested') }}
           ),
           comparison as (
               select
                   m.primary_key,
                   m.{{ Target Column(s) }} as actual_value,                   
                   -- Re-apply the transformation logic from the "Derivation Rule/Condition" here.                   
                   -- **CRITICAL ALIAS REPLACEMENT**: The 'Derivation Rule/Condition' from the test plan might use aliases like 'T1', 'T2', etc. You MUST replace those aliases with 's' to match the `source_data` CTE alias in this test query. For example, if the rule is `T1.col_a`, you must convert it to `s.col_a`.
                   -- Example: CASE WHEN s.source_col_1 = 'X' THEN 'Y' ELSE 'Z' END as expected_value
                   ({{ Derivation Rule/Condition }}) as expected_value
               from model_data m
               join source_data s on m.primary_key = s.primary_key
           )
           select *
           from comparison
           -- The `is not distinct from` operator correctly handles NULL comparisons.
           where (actual_value is not distinct from expected_value) = false
           ```

    6. **Example of Final Output Structure**:
       The following is a brief example of the required output format. Remember, you MUST generate a script for **every single test case** in the provided test plan CSV, not just the two tests shown in this example.

       - The CSV should include the following columns. Each column name should be enclosed in double quotes.
         - **"Test ID"**: A unique identifier for the test case that will match the dbt test name. Use the format `assert_{model_name}_{test_scenario_slug}` (e.g., `assert_ons_postcode_is_unique`).
         - **"Test Scenario"**: A clear, concise description of what is being tested.
         - **"Model/Component Tested"**: The dbt model or component the test applies to (e.g., `your_model_name`).
         - **"Test Type"**: The category of test (e.g., "Data Integrity", "Transformation Logic", "Uniqueness", "Null Check", "Referential Integrity", "Accepted Values", "Format Check").
         - **"Source Columns"**: Relevant source columns involved in the test (comma-separated if multiple).
         - **"Target Column(s)"**: The target column(s) being validated (comma-separated if multiple).
         - **"Expected Result"**: A description of the expected outcome if the transformation or data quality rule is correctly applied.
         - **"Derivation Rule/Condition"**: If applicable, the specific derivation rule or business condition from the STTM that this test validates.
         - **"Test Data Considerations"**: Any specific data conditions or edge cases that this test targets (e.g., "NULL values in source", "Specific date ranges", "Empty strings").
         - **"Priority"**: (High, Medium, Low) based on the criticality of the data or transformation.

       - **Infer Test Cases from STTM**: You must analyze the STTM and generate a focused but comprehensive set of test cases. **The total number of generated test cases MUST NOT exceed 20.** Prioritize the following scenarios to stay within the limit:
         - **Transformation Logic Tests (Highest Priority)**: For each row that has a non-empty 'Transformation Logic / Derivation Rule', generate **exactly one** 'Transformation Logic' test case to validate it. This is the most important category.
         - **Primary Key/Unique Key Tests (High Priority)**: For any column that appears to be a primary or unique key, generate both a 'Uniqueness' and a 'Not Null' test case.
         - **Referential Integrity Tests (Medium Priority)**: For up to 3 of the most critical 'Join Key' columns, generate a 'Referential Integrity' test.
         - **Accepted Values Tests (Medium Priority)**: If a transformation results in a column having a fixed set of values, generate one 'Accepted Values' test for that column.
         - **General Nullability Tests (Low Priority)**: For up to 3 other important target columns that are not primary keys but are expected to be populated, generate a 'Null Check' test case.
       - **Do not generate test cases for other scenarios** like format checks or volume checks unless they are part of a specific transformation rule. This focus will help you stay under the 20-test-case limit.
